      " In 2020\n",
      " our industry came together globally to commit to a 2050 climate ambition and align with global climate targets\n",
      " That ambition was to drive down the CO2 footprint of our operations and products and aspire to deliver society with carbon-neutral concrete by 2050\n",

      " It will require the industry to significantly accelerate the sustainability progress we have already achieved\n",
      " Over the last 30 years\n",
      " we have collectively reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 20% per ton of cementitious material\n",
      " And we are now setting out our commitment to a similar reduction by 2030 in just a third of the time on our way to achieving net-zero\n",
