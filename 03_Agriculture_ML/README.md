# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

Machine learning model to predict crop suitability based on soil measurements.

## Problem

Farmers need to know which crops will thrive based on soil conditions. This project builds a model to recommend crops based on soil metrics.

## Dataset

Soil measurements including:
- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels
- pH value
- Soil moisture

## Approach

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Feature importance analysis
3. Model comparison (multiple classifiers)
4. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
5. Model persistence with pickle

## Results

The final model achieves high accuracy in predicting suitable crops based on soil conditions.
