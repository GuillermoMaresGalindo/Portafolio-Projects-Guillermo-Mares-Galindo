# HR Analytics: Employee Churn Prediction

Predicting which employees are likely to leave the company.

## Problem

Employee turnover is expensive. This project analyzes factors driving churn and builds a predictive model.

## Dataset

Employee data including:
- Satisfaction level
- Last evaluation score
- Number of projects
- Average monthly hours
- Time at company
- Work accidents
- Promotions
- Department
- Salary level

## Analysis

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Correlation analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC curves)
6. Feature importance

## Key Findings

- Satisfaction is the strongest predictor of churn
- Employees with 2 or 7+ projects have higher turnover
- Low salary correlates with higher churn risk
